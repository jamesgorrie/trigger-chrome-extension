# Guarian Trigger
## Chrome extension

We are still in development mode, but will be releasing to the store soon.
If you would like to have a go, [please email us](mailto:discussion.feedback@theguardian.com?subject=Trigger: request to be trusted tester) asking to get involved as one of our trusted testers. 

Once you've installed the extension:

* Open the popup
* Enter your username
* If anything goes awry [log it in github](https://github.com/jamesgorrie/trigger-chrome-extension/issues) or [email us](mailto:discussion.feedback@theguardian.com?subject=Trigger: issue report)

Happy commenting!
