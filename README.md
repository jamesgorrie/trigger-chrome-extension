# Guarian Trigger

We are still in development mode, but will be releasing to the store soon.

You can [upnpack this extension manually](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) to have a go in the meantime.

Once you have done that, open the popup, enter your username, and you should be ay and away.

If you have any feedback or spot anything wrong, please [leave us a note on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesgorrie/trigger-chrome-extension/issues)

Happy commenting!
